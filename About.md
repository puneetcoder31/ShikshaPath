One-Stop Personalized Career & Education Advisor

Students often struggle to choose the right stream, degree, and career path after Class 10/12 due to lack of awareness, leading to dropouts and low enrollment in government colleges. We propose a  web platform offering quiz-based career suggestions, course-to-career mapping, nearby college directory,  and AI-driven personalized chatbot for career advice . With offline features for low-internet areas, the solution empowers students with clarity, boosts enrollment, and strengthens trust in government education as a viable career pathway.
